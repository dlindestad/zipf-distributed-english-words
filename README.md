Funbox suggestion for monkeytype.

ngram.py sorts the monkeytype english 10k wordlist by the "google-10000-english-no-swears.txt" word list provided by worldlywisdom: [google-10000-english](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english)

ngram.py implements the fast zipf functions by Jason Crease: [Generating Zipfian random-variables](https://jasoncrease.medium.com/zipf-54912d5651cc)

example.py generates an example string with 20 words, drawn from the English 10k word list, following a zipf distribution.
